# MNPY - PHP API SDK

[MNPY](https://mnpy.io/) | [Documentation](https://mnpy.gitbooks.io/mnpy-api/content/)

Start accepting over hundreds cryptocurrencies without minimum costs, fixed contracts and hidden costs. At MNPY you pay for successful transactions only. Read more at [MNPY](https://mnpy.io/).

## Requirements
It's easy to start using MNPY, you need;

* PHP >7.0
* A [MNPY account](https://mnpy.io/dashboard/register)
* A Ethereum wallet, preferably ERC20 compliant


## Installation

You are encouraged to install the PHP SDK using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

```
$ composer require mnpy/mnpy-php-api-sdk
```

Optionally, you can checkout the git repository and manually load the required files.

## Getting started

Require the autoloader generated by Composer (or build your own) and initialize one of the resources. In this example we will use the Transaction resource.

```php
$transaction = new Transaction('API_KEY');
```

optinally, you can set the API key by calling the `setApiKey` method on the resource like so;

```php
$transaction->setApiKey('API_KEY');
```

Now you can create a transaction by calling the create method. The method signature is as following:

```php
public function create(string $merchant_name, float $price, string $address, string $redirect_url, array $options);
```

Where the options are all the additional parameters as defined in the [documentation](https://mnpy.gitbooks.io/mnpy-api/content/). When taking this in account we can create a transaction like so;

```php
$tx = $transaction->create(
   'MNPY Store',
   100,
   '0x960819D261AbaF8df1F7cc0b8Cb5CaA30410cC6f',
   'https://mnpy.io/',
   [
        'fee'  => 5,
        'code' => 'VEN'
   ]
);
```

If succesful, `$tx` will now contain all the required transaction data.

To retrieve a transaction, you can simply do;

```php
$tx = $transaction->get($tx->uuid);

echo $tx->status;
```
